I am a junior undergraduate student double majored in computer science and data science at the University of Michigan.
As a research assistant, I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [David Jurgens](https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/) at [Blablablab](https://blablablab.si.umich.edu/).

Previously, I was a Software Engineering Intern at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/about.html),
worked with the Deep learning side of high-performance computing. We broke the [DAWNBench](https://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/benchmark/) ImageNet training record on training ResNet-50 to 93% top-5 accuracy in 151 seconds [(paper link)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10458).

Interests (broadly): natural language processing, machine learning, computational sociolinguistics,
human-computer interaction, machine reasoning.

I am actively seeking 2021 summer research and internship opportunities! &#128516;
